Cadmium Nitrate is a colorless, crystalline, inorganic compound that forms toxic fumes of cadmium oxides when heated. Calcium nitrate is used in the production of cadmium hydroxide for use in alkaline batteries, to color glass and porcelain, in photography and in nuclear reactors. Exposure to this substance irritates the eyes, skin and respiratory tract and causes damage to the lungs resulting in shortness of breath, chest pain and pulmonary edema, and can also damage the kidneys causing proteinuria and decreased renal function. Calcium nitrate is a known carcinogen and is associated with an elevated risk of developing lung cancer. Nitric acid (HNO3). A colorless liquid that is used in the manufacture of inorganic and organic nitrates and nitro compounds for fertilizers, dye intermediates, explosives, and many different organic chemicals. Continued exposure to vapor may cause chronic bronchitis; chemical pneumonitis may occur. (From Merck Index, 11th ed)NITRIC ACID, RED FUMING is a pale yellow to reddish brown liquid generating red-brown fumes and having a suffocating odor. Very toxic by inhalation. Corrosive to metals or tissue. Prolonged exposure to low concentrations or short term exposure to high concentrations may result in adverse health effects. Rate of onset: Immediate Persistence: Hours - days Odor threshold: ~1 ppm Source/use/other hazard: Used in many industries; Very corrosive to skin/mucous membranes as well as metals & other materials.A free radical gas produced endogenously by a variety of mammalian cells, synthesized from ARGININE by NITRIC OXIDE SYNTHASE. Nitric oxide is one of the ENDOTHELIUM-DEPENDENT RELAXING FACTORS released by the vascular endothelium and mediates VASODILATION. It also inhibits platelet aggregation, induces disaggregation of aggregated platelets, and inhibits platelet adhesion to the vascular endothelium. Nitric oxide activates cytosolic GUANYLATE CYCLASE and thus elevates intracellular levels of CYCLIC GMP.Nitric oxide is a Vasodilator. The physiologic effect of nitric oxide is by means of Vasodilation.Nitric Oxide is an unstable free-radical gas which reacts rapidly with oxygen to form nitrogen oxides. Water soluble, NO is produced normally in numerous tissues and is considered to be a mediator of cell-to cell communication; it functions in numerous processes including vasodilation, inflammation, and neurotransmission. (NCI04)Nickel nitrate is a green crystalline solid. It is soluble in water. It is noncombustible, but it will accelerate the burning of combustible materials. If large quantities are involved in a fire or the combustible material is finely divided, an explosion may result. Prolonged exposure to fire or heat may result in an explosion. Toxic oxides of nitrogen are produced in fires involving this material. It is used in nickel plating and to make nickel catalysts for use in chemical manufacture.MERCURIC NITRATE is a white crystalline solid. Toxic by inhalation, ingestion and/or skin contact. Prolonged exposure to fire or heat may result in an explosion. Produces toxic oxides of nitrogen when heated to decomposition. Used to make other chemicals and in medicine.ETHYL NITRATE is a clear colorless liquid with a pleasant odor. Prolonged exposure to fire or heat may cause vigorous decomposition and rupturing of the container. Denser than water and insoluble in water. Vapors are heavier than air. Produces toxic oxides of nitrogen during combustion.
