    "text = \"\"\"Benzoyl peroxide was first made in 1905 and came into medical use in the 1930s.[5] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system.[10] Benzoyl peroxide is available as a generic medication and over the counter.[8] In the United Kingdom 150 ml of a 10% solution costs the NHS about Â£4.[4] In the United States a month of treatment costs less than US$25.[8] Benzoyl peroxide is effective for reducing the number and severity of acne lesions. Benzoyl peroxide has a bactericidal effect on Propionibacterium acnes bacteria associated with acne and does not induce antibiotic resistance.[12][13] It may be combined with salicylic acid, sulfur, erythromycin or clindamycin (antibiotics), or adapalene (a synthetic retinoid). Two common combination drugs include benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin and adapalene/benzoyl peroxide, an unusual formulation considering most retinoids are deactivated by peroxides. Combination products such as benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide/salicylic acid appear to be slightly more effective than benzoyl peroxide alone for the treatment of acne lesions.[13]\"\"\"\n",
